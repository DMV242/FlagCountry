Your challenge is integrating with the REST Countries API to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

You can use any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end, such as React or Vue. You also have complete control over which packages you use to make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:

See all countries from the API on the homepage
Search for a country using an input field
Filter countries by region
Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
Click through to the border countries on the detail page
View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
Bonus: Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
Download the starter code and go through the README.md file. This will provide further details about the project. The style-guide.md file is where you'll find colors, fonts, etc.
